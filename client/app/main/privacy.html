<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Splyt (c) respects your privacy and the security of your personal information. Please check this page often; the policy will change as Splyt grows.</p>

<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally identifiable information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact,or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our application.</p>

<h3>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h3>

<p>When registering for an account on Splyt (signing in with a Google+ account), as appropriate, you will be prompted for permissions from Google for access to certain information from your Google+ account. You can decline consent to provide that information when prompted. We do not collect information from any visitors to the app who have not registered.</p>

<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>

<p>We may use the information (specifically, your email address) we collect when you register to allow other users to identify you in a search for other users to follow within the app. If user B follows user A, user B only ever has access to user A’s name, email and the songs user A adds to his/her playlists.</p>

<h3>How do we protect user information?</h3>

<p>Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures when a user registers or access their information to maintain safety of personal information.</p>

<h3>Do we use cookies?</h3>

<p>Yes. Cookies are files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer/browser (if your browser allows) that enables the app to recognize your browser and capture/remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to remember when you logged in and keep an active session alive, instead of requiring users to log in whenever a tab or window is closed.</p>

<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent or saved, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do so through your browser’s settings/preferences.</p>

<h3>If users disable cookies in their browser:</h3>

<p>Some features will be disabled that make the app experience more efficient.</p>

<h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3>
<p>We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PII.</p>

<h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
<p>The core concept of Splyt is to support third party music providers in one centralized place. Through the use of APIs and other techniques, we provide third party access to already public, streamable and/or free content on other services, including Tumblr, Soundcloud and YouTube. It is important to read these companies’ sharing policies as well.</p>

<h3>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>
<p>We fully comply with California’s privacy legislation as it relates to dealing with California’s residents.</p>
