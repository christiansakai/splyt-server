## How it Works

The web app is home to all of the music you've added around the web via our extension. Here, you can create new playlists, move songs between playlists, follow friends, add songs from your friends' music feed to your own playlists, and most importantly, listen to the playlists you've made with our custom built player - powered by Soundcloud, Youtube, and Tumblr audio. You can even search Youtube/Soundcloud for songs and add them to your Splyt playlists from directly within the app.
